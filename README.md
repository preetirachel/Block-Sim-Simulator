# Block Sim Simulator
 BlockSim is an open source blockchain simulator, capturing network, consensus and incentives layers of blockchain systems. BlockSim aims to provide simulation constructs that are intuitive, hide unnecessary detail and can be easily manipulated to be applied to a large set of blockchains design and deployment questions (related to performance, reliability, security or other properties of interest). At the core of BlockSim is a Base Model, which contains a number of functional blocks (e.g., blocks, transactions and nodes) common across blockchains, that can be extended and configured as suited for the system and study of interest. BlockSim is implemented in Python.
